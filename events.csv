description,Welcome to the Districtr Community of Interest public mapping tool for Goleta's 2021 city council redistricting.
,"As part of the redistricting process, the California FAIR MAPS Act includes neighborhoods and “Communities of Interest” as important considerations. California law defines Communities of Interest as “a population that shares common social or economic interests that should be included within a single district for purposes of its effective and fair representation.”"
,"To let the City know about your community and what brings it together, share your map and your story using this tool now."
,"To display your map on this page, be sure the tag ""Goleta"" is filled out after you've clicked ""Save"" to share the map."
about,"City of Goleta City Council District Boundaries must be redrawn every 10 years using U.S. Census data in order to make the four districts as equal in population as possible and that each member represents about the same number of constituents. The City encourages residents to participate by suggesting neighborhood and community of interest maps of areas that should be kept undivided, and full four-district map suggestions for the whole county."
,This mapping module displays projected 2020 population based on the American Community Survey data disaggregated onto Census blocks. The data was prepared by National Demographics Corporation.
