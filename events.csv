about,"City of Goleta City Council District Boundaries must be redrawn every 10 years using U.S. Census data in order to make the four districts as equal in population as possible and that each member represents about the same number of constituents. The City encourages residents to participate by suggesting neighborhood and community of interest maps of areas that should be kept undivided, and full four-district map suggestions for the whole county."

description,Welcome to the Community Mapping page managed by Common Cause PA.
,"This is a space where maps created by Communities of Interest (COI) are held until the COI determines what will be done with that map (i.e. unity map, independent submission, regional maps). Common Cause will be working with organizations, groups and communities across the state to collect a critical mass of community maps. These maps, whether as a part of a larger unity map or as independent maps, will be submitted to the Legislative Reapportionment Commission (LRC) to consider as they draft the state legislative districts map."
